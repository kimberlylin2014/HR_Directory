### Website Features
* This application allows employees to have access to their company directory data.
* Users first need to search for the company, then they have the option to sign in or sign up.
* When an user signs in, the application will check if the user has authorization. If user is not listed in the company's directory, the user will be denied access.
* If user is a new employee, he/she will sign up for a new account and be added to the database.
* If it's the user's first time logging in, the app will ask user to complete a Profile Information Form. 
* Users are able to edit their Profile Information Form at any time. 
* User may upload photo files from the local computer.

### Focus
* Build resuable/clean components with React-Redux and handle the backend with Firebase and Redux-Saga.
* Memoize functions with the Reselect Library.
* Implement React Router to navigate through different pages of the website without page refresh.
* Redux Persist is utilized to save the state of the current user and company whenever the page refreshes.
* Data Association.
